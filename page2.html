		<h2>NET NUETRALITY</h2>
		<p style="text-indent: 40px">	Net nuetrality has recently come into the limelight as the laws that were protecting
			it were recently at debate to be disbanded. Luckly very little action against net
			nuetrality was actualy taken. Because, in my opinion net nutrality is very important in
			our modern world, as it provides digital freedom when it comes to the internet.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 40px"> The magazine "NewScientist" wrote an article in its January 31st, 2015 issue that highlights
			the importance of net nuetrality. They talk about the main feature of net nuetrality as it makes sure
			all websites are able to be accessed at the same internet speed for the same price. For example some
			internet providers would have liked to make user pay extra to access Netfix at the same high speeds as the
			rest of the internet. This is super important because if net nutrality had been disbanded compleatly
			my website the one that this post is on would hardly be accessible or could possibly no longer exist.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 40px"> So in the future if net nutrality is put at risk or has a chance of being strenthened, think of the freedoms that 
			you take for granted on the internet and stand up for them.
